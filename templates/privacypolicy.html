Our policy is to not give, sell or otherwise distribute the information collected through this site to third parties outside of Oceanic Express Corporation and its subsidiaries (unless required by law); provided, however, in some cases we may use suppliers to assist us in collecting, using or otherwise processing for our benefit the information obtained through this site. Our practice is to require our suppliers to conduct such activities consistent with this policy and our requirements.

4. What happens when I leave Oceanic Express.com to visit a Oceanic Express linked web site?
Parts of Oceanic Express.com, such as Oceanic Express Global Trade Manager, consist of products and services hosted by third-party businesses. When you leave Oceanic Express.com to visit one of these sites, the only information transferred to the third-party is the fact that you came from Oceanic Express.com (the referring address).

This practice allows the third-party to monitor its own web site traffic, but does not provide them with any information about you. Oceanic Express is not responsible or liable for the independent privacy policies of our third-party sites. You should consult the privacy policies at those sites to determine how your information may be used.

5. What is a cookie?
A cookie is a series of data characters that, when programmed into a web site, is placed by the web server into the browser's application folder on your computer. Once placed onto your machine, the cookie will allow the web site to "recognize" you as a unique individual.

6. Does Oceanic Express use cookies?
Cookies are used to achieve two goals. The first is to provide Oceanic Express with the capability to personalize information for certain segments of its customer base. Secondly, in some instances, cookies are used to allow Oceanic Express the opportunity to associate individual customers with their information profiles. For example, through the use of cookies, Oceanic Express.com Login can "remember" your user ID when you login to Oceanic Express Ship Manager at Oceanic Express.com on your computer.
